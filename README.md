# TestRotaryEncoder

This is test software for my fully 3D printed design for a Dual 
Concentric Rotary Encoder with Push Button. It's useful for 
making the knobs for flight-sim radio panels, where there is an 
outer knob to set the smaller digits, and an inner knob to set 
the larger digits.

You can read more about the part here: http://blog.shahada.abubakar.net/post/diy-dual-concentric-rotary-encoders-with-push-button.

This test program connects the device to X-Plane via the ExtPlane 
Plugin, and demonstrates controlling the X-Plane G1000's COM
radios.

You will need to install my <a href="https://github.com/dotsha747/libXPlane-ExtPlane-Client">X-Plane ExtPlane Client library</a>.
